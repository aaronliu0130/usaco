# usaco

This is the repository for my usaco solutions.
Most of the code are completly done by me, some code have the thinking from someone else, and some code have been refined after reading analysis.

## Build

To build, use the command `g++ -std=c++11 -o "<problem-name>" <problem-name>.cpp`. Replace `<problem-name>` for the name of the problem that specific source file resolves e.g. `g++ -std=c++11 -o "test" test.cpp`. If you're on windows, use the command `g++ -std=c++11 -o "<problem-name>.exe" <problem-name>.cpp` e.g. `g++ -std=c++11 -o "test.exe" test.cpp`.

## Status

Currently, all problems 1.1~2.4 have been finished.
