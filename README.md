# usaco

This is the repository for my usaco solutions.

## Build

To build, use the command `g++ -std=c++11 -o "<problem-name>" <problem-name>.cpp`. Replace `<problem-name>` for the name of the problem that specific source file resolves e.g. `g++ -std=c++11 -o "test" test.cpp`. If you're on windows, use the command `g++ -std=c++11 -o "<problem-name>.exe" <problem-name>.cpp` e.g. `g++ -std=c++11 -o "test.exe" test.cpp`.

## Status

Currently, all problems 1.1~2.4 have been finished.
